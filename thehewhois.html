<h2>The He Who Is</h2>
<h4>
Too young to remember<br>
Too old to forget<br>
A bit of both worlds<br>
Does one want to remember or forget?<br>
Is one trying to let go or hold on to it?<br>
A part of him says let go, it's time to forget<br>
But a part of him is not able to,<br>
He feels trapped<br>
Trapped in himself<br>
He has found comfort in the olden ways even<br>
though it’s not honey and flowers<br>
Or maybe it is<br>
Past that aren’t pleasant yet they are comforting<br>
he ponders on why he has found comfort in them<br>
why he is not able to forget all of it, but that would be impossible, wouldn’t it?<br>
he’s not sure if he wants to forget, not sure if he can let go<br>
He is unsure about many things<br>
it hurts yet it is comforting<br>
Solace he hasn’t found in the external world<br>
or maybe he’s been too ignorant to the world<br>
But what does he mean by hurt?<br>
Is it visible?<br>
Is one able to see if he is hurting?<br>
He wonders if he's playing monopoly with a single coin<br>
He is aloof, insensitive to others<br>
Or maybe he’s afraid of us, afraid of our judgements<br>
After all, we have judged him so much<br>
He fears it’s continuation<br>
He fears this feeling will never him<br>
The emptiness and the void<br>
He shall not care for he is destined for oblivion<br>
