<h2>Death</h2>
<h4>
When one experiences the most unbearable pain in their life, they say I felt like dying<br>
well, of course, it is bearable, but one cannot help but feel that it's unendurable<br>
But that is not what we want to argue<br>
the metaphor between death and pain is unjust<br> 
Death is something one has never experienced until one is gone<br>
So how could one know “it felt like dying”?<br>
And death is better than those momentary sufferings<br>
Because once you are gone, then there is no pain, no anguish, no disappointments<br>
Because one doesn’t feel anymore<br>
One is not clung to the idea to be loved, to be seen, to feel content<br>
But dear, what would I know? I haven’t experienced death as well<br>
But only wished to at times<br>
