<h2>A loss</h2>
<h4>
I am gaining a sea but I am also leaving an ocean behind.<br>
The past is becoming blurry, like a haze.<br>
I am forgetting so much, the warmth of playing with mud, the days, the excitement over mundane things.<br>
Was there ever a yesterday?<br>
Did I enjoy it or am I reminiscing only for its sake?<br>
Everything seems like a star, it can be seen, but I can neither touch nor feel it, as if this has been the only life I have lived.<br>
As if this person right now has always been me.<br>
I don’t hate who I am now, maybe I do and I am not aware of it.<br>
It has to pass, all things do, but why does it feel like a loss and not passing?<br>
I have lost it all is all I ponder. I’m losing something, what is that thing I wonder?<br>
Is it a concrete object for that would be easier to deal with.<br>
Is it a feeling?<br>
I sigh and I am already exhausted,<br>
how could I feel a sensation that I don’t even remember but merely am aware of its loss.<br>
Wanting something where the desire of want is stronger than the awareness of that desire bemuses me,<br>
I wonder if I only want what I want or am I longing for one taste of that feeling or whatever that might be?<br>
