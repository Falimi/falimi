<h2>Happiness</h2>
<h4>
Things make me happy, people make me smile but does it also mean I am happy as a person?<br>

There is an emptiness, a void that is lurking within me at times when the corners of my mouth are still,<br>

when it feels there is no other human on this earth.<br>

It’s the blank spaces within each smile.<br>

Within each laughter.<br>

Within each facade.<br>

Within each interaction.<br>

I don’t know what it is sometimes. Or do I?<br>

Perhaps this is what happiness feels like.<br>

Happiness filled with emptiness.<br>

I have been told about the importance of joy and contentment all my life.<br>

I must find it.<br>

It is paramount, I have been told.<br>

Maybe a thing as complete contentment doesn’t exist at all.<br>

Or maybe it does but not what you and I think.<br>

What I have been told.<br>

Maybe within happiness, there is melancholy, and despair, and laughter, and a hollowness, and weariness.<br>

To be happy would mean to be sad as well. To be sad would mean to pretend as well.<br>
